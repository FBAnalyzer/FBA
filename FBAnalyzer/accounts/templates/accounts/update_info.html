              <h4>New update info 16.9.2023</h4>
              <p>NEW functionality added to Floorball Scanner.</p>
              <p>Based on user requests we have updated the software to include ball possession gains and losses
              that can now be tagged to shotmap both line and player based.</p>
              <p>New update functionalities are:</p>
              <h7>Possession + and Possession -</h7>
              <ul>
                <li>Pressing the shotmap opens up a more extensive list of shot types, including Possession + and
                Possession -. If Shooter tagging is on, it is also possible to tag which player lost or gained ball possession.
                Possession + and - only works for Team 1 and Ball possession selection does not affect the player selection
                but only Team 1 players can be selected.</li>
                <li>Blue o symbol means gained ball possession (your player takes ball possession from the opponent),
                red o symbol means lost ball possession.</li>
                <li>Player and line possession + and - are also added to Line and Player charts</li>
              </ul>
              <h7>Automatic Team 2 line change removed</h7>
              <ul>
                <li>Automatic Team 2 line change for 5-5 lines (lines 1 - 3) are removed, because it enables future
                development to calculate automatically number of shifts started with or without ball for lines.</li>
                <li>Automatic Team 2 line change is still working for Powerplay and Shorthanded lines</li>
              </ul>
              <h7>Shooter and Passer tagging on Powerplay and 6v5</h7>
              <ul>
                <li>It is now possible to tag shooter and passer on Powerplay and 6v5 special teams.</li>
                <li>Shot xG and pass xG are calculated on respective columns on line and player tables so
                they can be seen separately from 5-5 xG.</li>
              </ul>
