                <h2>New update info 16.9.2023</h2><br>
                <p>NEW functionality added to Floorball Scanner.</p>
                <p>Based on user requests we have updated the software to include ball possession gains and losses
                that can now be tagged to shotmap both line and player based.</p>
                <p>New update functionalities:</p>

                <h5>Possession + and Possession -</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Pressing the shotmap opens up a more extensive list of shot types, now with Possession + and
                    Possession -. If Shooter tagging is on, it is also possible to tag which player lost or gained ball possession.
                    Possession + and - only works for Team 1 and Ball possession selection does not affect the player selection
                    but only Team 1 players can be selected.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Blue o symbol means gained ball possession (your player takes ball possession from the opponent),
                    red o symbol means lost ball possession.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Player and line possession + and - are also added to Line and Player charts</li>

                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Automatic Team 2 line change for 5-5 lines (lines 1 - 3) are removed, because it enables future
                    development to calculate automatically number of shifts started with or without ball for lines.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Automatic Team 2 line change is still working for Powerplay and Shorthanded lines</li>

                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">It is now possible to tag shooter and passer on Powerplay and 6v5 special teams.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type:circle">Shot xG and pass xG are calculated on respective columns on line and player tables so
                    they can be seen separately from 5-5 xG.</li>
