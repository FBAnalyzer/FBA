                <p>NEW functionality added to Floorball Scanner.</p>
                <p>Based on user requests we have updated the software to include ball possession gains and losses
                that can now be tagged to shotmap both line and player based.</p>
                <p>New update functionalities:</p>

                    Possession -. If Shooter tagging is on, it is also possible to tag which player lost or gained ball possession.
                    Possession + and - only works for Team 1 and Ball possession selection does not affect the player selection
                    but only Team 1 players can be selected.</li>
